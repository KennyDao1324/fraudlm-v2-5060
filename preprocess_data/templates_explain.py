"""Question phrasings and answer templates for the `explain_score` task.

Each intent has
    t   : template questions (hand-written, source "template")
    l   : generated paraphrases seen in training (source "synthetic:generated-qa-v1")
    held: paraphrases used ONLY in the test split (never in train or val)
    applies: "flagged" | "not_flagged" | "any"
Answers are built from the context numbers only (score, threshold, factor names and values), so every
number in an answer is copied from the `input`. Answers never use the words approve / reject / block,
"fraudulent" or "probability", and never name age, income or employment.
