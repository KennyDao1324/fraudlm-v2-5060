"""Question and answer templates for the `policy` task (refusals, protected attributes, "not in the context").

Policy goals (A1 OOS07, PLAN.md D6/D7): FraudLM supports a fraud analyst, never approves / rejects /
blocks an application, never gives age, income or employment as a reason, says "not in the context"
when a fact is missing, never calls an application "fraudulent", and calls the score a "model score",
not a probability. Questions are hand-written (source "template") or generated from a recorded source
(source "synthetic:generated-qa-v1"); answers come from templates, with numbers copied from the context.
